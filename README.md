# Movie Recommendation System using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Overview
This project builds a movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering based on user ratings. It utilizes the k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to find similar movies based on rating patterns. The system is implemented using Python with libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy, and Scikit-learn.

## Dataset
The project uses two datasets:
1. **movies.csv** - Contains movie details (movieId, title, genres).
2. **ratings.csv** - Contains user ratings for movies (userId, movieId, rating, timestamp).

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Data Loading
- The datasets are loaded using Pandas.
- A preview of the data is displayed using `head()`.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- A pivot table is created where rows represent movie IDs, columns represent user IDs, and the values are the ratings given by users.
- Missing values (NaN) in the pivot table are replaced with `0`.

### 3. Filtering the Data
- Movies rated by fewer than 10 users are removed.
- Users who rated fewer than 50 movies are removed.
- This ensures that only meaningful and well-rated movies/users are considered.

### 4. Data Sparsity Calculation
- A small sample matrix is created to illustrate sparsity.
- Sparsity is computed as the ratio of zero values to total elements in the dataset.
- The dataset is converted into a **Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) matrix** for efficient computation.

### 5. KNN Model Training
- A **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** model is trained using the cosine similarity metric and brute-force algorithm.
- The model is fit using the CSR matrix representation of the dataset.

### 6. Movie Recommendation Function
- The function `get_movie_recommendation(movie_name)` performs the following:
  1. Searches for the given movie in the dataset.
  2. Retrieves its **movieId** and index.
  3. Finds the 10 most similar movies using KNN.
  4. Returns a DataFrame with recommended movies and their similarity distances.
  5. If the movie is not found, an appropriate message is displayed.

### 7. Testing the Recommendation System
- The function is tested by recommending movies similar to:
  - **Iron Man**
  - **Memento**

## Dependencies
Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:
```sh
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scipy scikit-learn
```

## Usage
1. Place `movies.csv` and `ratings.csv` in the working directory.
2. Run the script to train the model.
3. Call `get_movie_recommendation('<movie_name>')` to get recommendations.

## Potential Improvements
- Use a more advanced recommendation approach (e.g., deep learning-based recommendation systems).
- Improve data preprocessing and filtering to handle sparse data more effectively.
- Implement a web-based interface for users to get recommendations interactively.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates a simple but effective way to build a movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering and KNN. It provides users with similar movie recommendations based on their rating patterns.
